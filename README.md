This is Quantum-Divination-Bot  
Hello, everyone! Here is the DIVINATION BLOCKS BOT.  
We made a robot that runs on jupyter-lab and shows the answer on discord.  
We wanted to choose some kind of game that can have both random properties of quantum and be a part of our local culture.  
After some brainstorming, we found that Jiaobei perfectly met our request.  
We wanted the robot to be an accessible way to help people learn quantum circuits.  
Thus, we designed three modes that can easily teach people about quantum probability.
