This is Quantum-Divination-Bot  
Hi everyone! Here is the DIVINATION BLOCKS BOT.  
We made a robot that is ran on jupyter-lab and show the answer on discord.  
We want to choose some kind of game that can both have random properties of quantum and it's part of our local culture.  
After some brainstorming, we found Jiaobei perfectly meet our request.  
We want the robot can be a accessible way to help people learn quamtum circuit.  
Thus we designed three mode that can easily teach people about the quantum probability.
